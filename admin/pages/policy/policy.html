        <p>PROTECTING YOUR INFORMATION <br><br>
          We have implemented reasonable measures to protect your personal information and to ensure the security of your orders and credit card information. Our servers use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) / Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption, an advanced technology.
          <br><br>
SSL/TLS is considered the industry standard and is among the leading protocol available to encrypt online transactions. Your personal information including your name, credit card number, and address is encrypted so that it cannot be read as it is transmitted over the Internet. Regardless of these efforts, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, any information you transmit to us is sent at your own risk.
<br><br>
Safe Shopping Guarantee
<br><br>
Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent credit card charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any amount up to the full $50.00, Hydrate will cover the entire liability. If you suspect unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card issuer in accordance with their reporting rules and procedures. Hydrate will cover this liability only if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted from purchases made on our secure server through no fault of your own.
<br><br>
Children’s Privacy
<br><br>
We do not intentionally collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will promptly remove it from our records.
<br><br>
Opt Out/Corrections
<br><br>
To request corrections to your personal data or opt-out of communications, please contact us. Upon your request, we will correct or update your personal information, cease sending emails to your email address, and/or disable your account to prevent future purchases through it. Please do not include sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, in your email.
<br><br>
Offline Collection, Use & Disclosure of Information
<br><br>
While this Privacy Policy primarily applies to online collection of personal information, we also endeavor to protect the privacy of your data offline. For example, if you call us to place an order or ask questions, we will only request the necessary personal information to fulfill your request. Any information stored offline, such as order details, will be entered into our database using SSL/TLS encryption.
<br><br>
Policy Changes
<br><br>
We reserve the right to amend our Privacy Policy periodically. We encourage you to refer to this Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed of any updates.
